\section{Subject Matter}\label{sec:subject matter}
In the healthcare sector and educational landscape, the efficient acquisition of domain-specific information is essential. 
In educational contexts such as universities, the basic practical and theoretical approach of students and teachers to complex domains, for example, medical informatics, is mostly developed through literature such as \citet{bb2}.
%
Several approaches already exist, as mentioned in \cref{sec:motivation}, to make the information accessible without having to manually read a textbook, such as \citet{bb2}.
This element holds significant relevance, as scenarios like exam or academic debate preparation primarily require reiterating and accessing the content within brief time-frames.
%
The process of extracting information not only requires accessibility for all users and short response times, but it also requires correctness and completeness, as academic consistency is its highest goal. 
Textbooks and academic literature are fragmented information sources, where relevant information is complex and interconnected throughout sections. 
Combining these fragments completely and correctly in context and therefore achieving the highest goals poses the decisive issues to overcome. 
%
Large context window \ac{llm}'s, as well as various improved \ac{rag}-systems, are recent advancements of AI to analyse vast quantities of data.
They open up new possibilities for overcoming the challenge of recognising complex contextual relationships, presenting the extracted information in context, and, at the same time, providing accessibility for any stakeholder.

\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem statement}
For students and practitioners in particular, practical application requires a deep understanding of the interrelationships and the applicability of the concepts presented to specific work environments.
The existing literature is often extensive, and the fragmentation and dispersion of relevant information across multiple sections and chapters often hinders the retrieval and synthesis of complex domain-specific information, such as within the field of medical informatics.
Identifying relevant knowledge for specific problems requires students and practitioners to read large parts of a book in order to fully grasp individual concepts and their relationships to other topics.
The scope of the literature sources and the fragmentation in the definition of technical terms make it difficult to acquire knowledge quickly, especially for students who want to understand basic concepts correctly.
%
In response to the need for manual source research in the past, new, mostly resource-limited approaches, as mentioned in \cref{sec:motivation}, were developed. 
These mainly solved partial problems, but always showed limitations, inaccuracies in their answers and incompleteness with regard to the requirements. 
%
Particularly, \citet{Paul_Keller} showed that the issue of inaccuracy exists but emphasised that it could be overcome by using state-of-the-art models and, with that, increasing the hardware resources. 
His conclusion leads us to another problem.   
Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence and information retrieval technologies, the practical implementation of these systems in resource-constrained environments, such as smaller educational institutions or even private learning settings, remains a considerable challenge. 
Limited availability of high-performance hardware necessitates a focus on cost-effective and especially accessible solutions for real-world educational and healthcare environments and the targeted stakeholders, students, teachers and researchers.
%
Key problems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Problem 1:} Fragmentation of knowledge in domain-specific literature, such as \\citet{bb}, still make it difficult to extract coherent and relevant information.
  \item \textbf{Problem 2:} Resource constraints prevent students and teachers from using advanced language models effectively.
\end{itemize}
%
Addressing these challenges is vital for enhancing the accessibility and utility of domain-specific knowledge, ultimately supporting both learning and research activities. 

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}
By leveraging these technologies, it becomes possible to retrieve relevant information from fragmented sources, as well as recognise, combine and precisely return contextual connections provided from the source as factually correct information. 
The key challenge is to find a retrieval model that not only solves the problem of fragmented knowledge, but also ensures accessibility and scientific and factual reliability.\\ 
In this context, \ac{qa} systems provide a practical and measurable approach to evaluate such information retrieval. 
These systems efficiently process targeted queries, providing insights into their applicability in educational scenarios and private settings.
% 
Previous projects, such as the \ac{snik} ontology, have made substantial progress in structuring information for hospital information systems management and therefore reach a certain level of accessibility. 
The integration of natural language processing in the context of a \ac{bell} resulting in the \enquote{Question Answering on \ac{snik}} \citep{hannesbell, hannesbell_skill}, as well as a similar approach in \citet{snikquiz}, attempted to combine complex knowledge networks with user-friendly access through natural English language queries. \citet{arneba}, on the other hand, explored an inverse approach using the \ac{snik} system. 
Instead of focusing on retrieving specific information through queries, this work aimed to provide the automatic generation of relevant questions, enhancing the system's usability in educational and training contexts.\\
%
These methods enabled a more structured approach to the information provided by the sources, as content was pre-processed and thus enabled, among other things, a basic \ac{qa}.
Nevertheless, they are limited when processing complex queries and cross-linked information scattered across sections.
The work of \citet{Paul_Keller} has already addressed these issues, recognising the challenges associated with managing information systems, especially the difficulty in translating theoretical information into practical applications and dealing with fragmented definitions in the literature, particularly in \citet{bb2}.
As a response to these challenges, the attempt was to solve the issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer in order to provide an efficient and reliable \ac{qa}-system built on \citet{bb2} as a literary information base.
In \citet{Paul_Keller}, it was shown that with training and fine-tuning these \ac{llm}'s can provide more comprehensible responses with an improvemed accuracy in explicit, limited reference to \citet{bb2}, as \enquote{[$\dots$]a MacroF1 value of \num{0.45} and answers \num{12} of \num{22} questions with at least one correct answer[$\dots$]} was achieved.\\\\ 
\enquote{The models presented [in \citet{Paul_Keller}] represent a snapshot in a specific environment but cannot make a general statement about the expected performance of continuous pre-training}\citep{Paul_Keller}.
They outperform untrained models, but compared to the GPT-4 model, which achieved \endquote{a MacroF1 value of \num{0.64} and \num{17} of \num{22} correctly answered questions[$\dots$]}\citep{Paul_Keller}, the self-training approach in a hardware-limited environment is confronted with clear capability differences.
%
The results suggest the potential for improvement. 
Such improvement may be reached through either the use of large scale hardware to fully exploit the capabilities of the previously used \ac{llm} models or by expanding the models with further techniques in order to reduce the occurrence of incorrect answers. \\
%
However, feasibility should be the focus for the stakeholders described, as currently available state-of-the-art models already have the potential to both further improve the result of the tests already carried out, e.g., \citet{Paul_Keller}, and at the same time be accessible by any stakeholder for any scenarios under consideration.
